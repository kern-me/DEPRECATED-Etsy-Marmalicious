# Marmalicious #
This applescript app is designed to help automate the process of filtering keyword data from the Marmalead platform.

## Objective ##
As an Etsy seller, I know how much time goes into Etsy SEO. There's no way around putting in time and effort for optimizing your listings for favorable position within Etsy search. As I was learning how it all works, I discovered that there were tasks that I was repeating frequently and were not serving me the learning process.

### Automation ###
Marmalead provides unfiltered keyword data and related search terms. This means more time spent on data parsing and organization. "Marmalicious" automates the following:

* Finding related keywords based on an existing list of keywords you create
* Filtering keywords with different criteria based on Marmalead's scores
* Saving and exporting keyword data to a spreadsheet (.csv)

## Requirements ## 
MacOS 10+
Safari
